# Configurator
A script to install everything you need on your computer to start programming in the FRC.

In Windows Terminal (or PowerShell) run ```(path-to-your-downloads)\WindowsProgrammingInstaller.py -a``` to start the configurator.
Certain features may need admin privileges (like ejecting the WPILib disk image).
